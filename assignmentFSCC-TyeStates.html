            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Tye States. I am a third year in the bachelor's of 
                computer science program at Acadia University.<br> I have lived in 
                Nova Scotia my entire life, having grown up in the West Hants
                municipality, specifically in Falmouth and Windsor.<br> I am not
                highly experienced in computer science fields in terms of work, but 
                in terms of academics I tend to perform relatively well.<br>My personal
                hope for a career is to work in the cybersecurity field because I find 
                that side of systems very interesting. 
            </p>
            <h2>what do I know?</h2>
            <p>
                Going into this class, I know the barest minimum amount of js, ts and SQL
                and have no experience at all in HTML<br> or the other languages we use
                in this course. I have poked around seeing what people can do with 
                the languages presented.<br> But I am still unclear on certain topics presented.
                For example, I am not fully aware of how Mongo is actually used,
                outside of it<br> being used for databases. I've also never heard of JQuery or AJAX
                but those are the exceptions, not the rule. I have heard of,<br> poked around,
                or even tried coding using all other languages here. I was planning on building
                a website anyway, and decided<br> to take this course to aid me. 
            </p>
            <h2>what do I want to learn?</h2>
            <p>
                Mainly, I want to learn the process that goes into each layer of the stack
                along with how to actually approach it.<br> I am also wanting to learn the 
                JS language, and the React framework when we get to those, having already<br> 
                learned how to embed Javascript into my HTML files. Also, during this course,
                I hope to gain an improved<br> understanding of database construction and queries, having only
                made very rudimentary database directly from Java.
